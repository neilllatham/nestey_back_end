Annual Performance Plan Creation Procedure:

🧩 Procedure: Create Annual Performance Plan
Purpose
The Create Annual Performance Plan procedure establishes a manager’s annual review record and their strategic objectives and goals for the new fiscal year.
These manager goals serve as the foundation for all downstream employee goal-setting and mid-year/annual reviews.

Process Overview


Identify the active review cycle (e.g., FY2025 Annual).


Create a new employee review record for the manager.


Insert objectives and goals under each corporate strategy (Customer, People, Shareholder).


Verify the plan to ensure all goals are linked correctly.



Example Implementation
------------------------------------------------------------
-- PROCEDURE: Create Annual Performance Plan
------------------------------------------------------------

-- Step 1: Confirm the active review cycle
SELECT review_cycle_id, name, cycle_type
FROM review_cycles
WHERE is_active = TRUE;

-- Example result: review_cycle_id = 1, name = 'FY2025 Annual'

-- Step 2: Create the manager’s review record
INSERT INTO employee_reviews (employee_id, review_cycle_id, review_status)
VALUES (301, 1, 'Draft');  -- Nader Logos, Manager

-- Step 3: Add strategic goals and objectives
INSERT INTO employee_goals (
  review_id, strategy_id, objective, goal_description, target_date,
  employee_rating, manager_rating, employee_comments, manager_comments
)
VALUES
-- Strategy: Customer
(1, 1, 'Enhance customer experience', 
 'Achieve a 15% increase in customer satisfaction scores by end of FY25', 
 '2025-12-31', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

-- Strategy: People
(1, 2, 'Improve employee engagement', 
 'Implement quarterly feedback surveys and increase engagement by 10%', 
 '2025-12-31', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

-- Strategy: Shareholder
(1, 3, 'Drive operational efficiency', 
 'Reduce operating cost per transaction to $5.00 through automation initiatives', 
 '2025-12-31', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);

-- Step 4: Verify
SELECT 
  e.full_name AS manager_name,
  rc.name AS review_cycle,
  s.strategy_name,
  g.objective,
  g.goal_description,
  g.target_date
FROM employee_goals g
JOIN employee_reviews er ON g.review_id = er.review_id
JOIN employees e ON er.employee_id = e.employee_id
JOIN strategies s ON g.strategy_id = s.strategy_id
JOIN review_cycles rc ON er.review_cycle_id = rc.review_cycle_id
WHERE e.employee_id = 301;


Outcome
This process creates:


A manager review record tied to the annual cycle.


A set of strategic objectives and goals mapped to the organization’s key strategies.


A verified dataset ready for employee goal alignment during mid-year planning.
